Contributing
------------

There are two ways to contribute:

* Via Github issues
* Sending git patches through email via pksg2d at mail.missouri.edu

To contribute via Github, follow these instructions:

- Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion
  around a feature idea or a bug.
- If you feel uncomfortable or uncertain about an issue or your changes,
  feel free to email Patrick Spencer at pksg2d at
  mail.missouri.edu and he will happily help you via email, irc, or
  whatever you are comfortable with.
- Fork `the repository <https://github.com/patrickspencer/mathdeck>`_ on
  GitHub to start making your changes to the **master** branch (or
  branch off of it).
- Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and
  published. Make sure to add yourself to AUTHORS.rst.
