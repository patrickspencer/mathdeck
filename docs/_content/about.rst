About
=====

Mathdeck is a program suite for managing the computations involved in
writing displaying, and grading mathematical based homework
problems. It is written to abstract the computations so that other
responsibilities such as managing users and grades can be left to more
apt systems such as online course management systems.

Features
--------

- A system for writing homework problems.
- A system for displaying problem files.
- A system for measuring how close a proposed solution is to a predefined
  solution and offering suggestions for improvement to lead a student in
  the right direction.

Goals
-----

- Clear API
- Clear documentation.
- Comprehensive test suite.
- Creating problems should be as easy as possible for people who
  are mathematically inclined and would be able to pick up the basics of
  python in a couple days.
