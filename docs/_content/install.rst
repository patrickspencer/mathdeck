Install
=======

Mathdeck is only supported on linux/unix operating systems right now.

To install mathdeck first copy ``mathdeckconf.json.sample`` to
``/etc/mathdeck/mathdeckcong.json`` and edit the attribute ``prob_lib_dir`` to the
absolute path of where your problem library is e.g. ``/var/problem_library``.
Then run ``python setup.py``.
